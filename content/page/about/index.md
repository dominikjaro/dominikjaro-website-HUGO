2021—the year I landed my first IT job. It was a helpdesk role at a mid-sized media company. My mindset? "Just get me in." But getting there wasn’t random.

Before IT, I put in long hours as a delivery driver and in restaurant kitchens, where I learned the value of hard work. Later, as a Customer Service Administrator at The Little Foxes Club (funny name, I know—great place to work!), I picked up strong communication skills. Answering emails, handling calls, and dealing with people in person became second nature. I learned patience—especially when handling anxious or, let’s say, *difficult* customers.

But IT was always the goal. I stayed on course, passing certifications like [examples] and completing personal projects. My Linux setup became my playground, and home servers kept me busy. Friends and family tickets piled up—I had been the go-to tech guy since childhood, after all.

Oh, and during COVID, I found myself doing something unexpected—teaching. I volunteered to help elderly people with basic computer skills and cybersecurity. Never thought I’d be a teacher, but I got good feedback (and patience became even more important!).
