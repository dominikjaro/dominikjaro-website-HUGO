# **My IT Journey: From Delivery Driver to Cloud Enthusiast ☁️**

## 🚀 Breaking into IT (2021)
**2021—the year I landed my first IT job.** It was a **helpdesk role** at a mid-sized media company. My mindset? *"Just get me in."* But getting there wasn’t random.  

Before IT, I put in **long hours** as a **delivery driver** and worked in **restaurant kitchens**—where I learned the value of **hard work**. Later, as a **Customer Service Administrator** at *The Little Foxes Club* (funny name, I know—great place to work!), I picked up **strong communication skills**. Answering emails, handling calls, and dealing with people in person became **second nature**. I learned **patience**—especially when handling anxious or, let’s say, *difficult* customers.  

## 💡 Always Focused on IT
- ✅ Passing **certifications** like COMPTIA A+ or Google Workspace Admin, see the certifications here [here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dominik-jaro/details/certifications/) 
- ✅ Completing **personal projects** (my **Linux setup** became my playground AND see my personal projects on [GitHub](https://github.com/dominikjaro?tab=repositories))  
- ✅ Becoming the **go-to tech guy** for family and friends  

Oh, and during **COVID**, I ended up doing something unexpected—**teaching**. I volunteered to help **elderly people** with **basic computer skills and cybersecurity**. Never thought I’d be a teacher, but I got good feedback (**and patience became even more important!**).

# **SSG IT Helpdesk: 3 Years of Growth 🖥️**  
I spent almost **3 years** at **SSG IT helpdesk**. It was fun, busy, sometimes relaxed—I experienced it all. Since we worked in **shifts**, **teamwork** was crucial.  

### 👨‍💻 My Progression to Team Leader
In my last year, I became the **team leader** of three other chaps. A few key things I accomplished:  
- 🔹 **Built** new **Windows images** 🏗️  
- 🔹 **Automated** repetitive tasks ⚡  
- 🔹 **Implemented** a new **ITSM system** 🛠️  
- 🔹 **Negotiated** the best price for this ITSM 💰  
- 🔹 **Handled** tons of **tickets and in-person requests** 📞  
- 🔹 **And much more**—everything you'd expect in an **IT helpdesk role**

# **☁️ The Cloud & DevOps Transition**  
No worries—I haven’t forgotten the goal. The **sky** is the limit! (*Or should I say **the cloud**?* 😆)  

I was eager to **develop more technical skills**, and I **loved configuring, organizing, and coding**. So, I **dove deep** into:  
- ✅ **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)** 🌍  
- ✅ **Infrastructure as Code (IaC) with Terraform** 🏗️  
- ✅ **Automation & DevOps concepts** 🔧  

The time **flew by** when I immersed myself in **Terraform** and cloud engineering.
There's **so much to learn**, and tech is **evolving daily**. Exciting times ahead! 🚀
