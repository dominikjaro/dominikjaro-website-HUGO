## ‚ú® Introduction: Evolving Our Automation

We previously used a dedicated GCP Cloud Build pipeline to run `terraform-docs` and commit changes back to GitHub. While functional, it was a separate system, introducing latency and complexity. The goal was simple: **make documentation generation part of the core GitOps workflow.**

We achieved this by integrating the `terraform-docs` binary directly into our custom **Atlantis Docker image** and triggering the documentation update as the first step of our atlantis plan workflow. This is faster, cleaner, and more robust!

(Note: For an introduction to Atlantis, see [https://www.runatlantis.io/] OR [Atlantis GitHub repo](https://github.com/runatlantis/atlantis).)

## ‚öôÔ∏è The New Architecture: Atlantis Native

We moved the entire automation pipeline inside the Atlantis execution environment. The key changes are:

1. **Custom Image:** The `terraform-docs` binary is now installed **once** into the Atlantis image.

2. **Workflow Hook:** A dedicated shell script (`terraform-docs-atlantis-workflow.sh`) is executed in the `plan` phase of our `atlantis.yaml`.

3. **Authentication:** The script leverages the existing Atlantis environment variables (`$ATLANTIS_GH_TOKEN`) for secure HTTPS authentication, eliminating the need for external Secret Manager volumes and SSH configuration.

## üê≥ Step 1: Building the Custom Atlantis Image

The new multi-stage Dockerfile is focused on injecting the necessary tool into the official base image, keeping the final deployment lightweight and stable.

### Dockerfile (Simplified)

We build the `terraform-docs` binary in a builder stage and then copy the binary into our base Atlantis image:

```Dockerfile
FROM alpine:3.20 AS builder

ARG TERRAFORM_DOCS_VERSION=0.20.0
ARG TERRAFORM_DOCS_ARCH=amd64

RUN apk add --no-cache curl

RUN curl -L -s --output terraform-docs.tar.gz "https://github.com/terraform-docs/terraform-docs/releases/download/v${TERRAFORM_DOCS_VERSION}/terraform-docs-v${TERRAFORM_DOCS_VERSION}-linux-${TERRAFORM_DOCS_ARCH}.tar.gz" && \
    tar -xzf terraform-docs.tar.gz && \
    chmod +x terraform-docs && \
    mv terraform-docs /usr/local/bin/terraform-docs

FROM <our-artifact-registry>/docker/atlantis:v0.36.0

# Switch to the root user to copy the binary into a system directory.
USER root

# Copy the terraform-docs binary from the builder stage.
COPY --from=builder /usr/local/bin/terraform-docs /usr/local/bin/terraform-docs

USER atlantis
```

### Makefile

The custom `Makefile` handles fetching the base Atlantis image, building our new image, and pushing it to Artifact Registry:

```Makefile
_DOCKER_REPO        := <our-artifact-registry>/docker
_DOCKER_IMAGE       := $(_DOCKER_REPO)/atlantis:v0.36.0
_TERRAFORM_VERSION := 1.5.7
_ATLANTIS_VERSION  := 0.36.0

.PHONY: build build-base push-base build-with-docs push-with-docs
build: build-base push-base build-with-docs push-with-docs

build-base:
    git clone https://github.com/runatlantis/atlantis.git
    cd atlantis/ && docker buildx build -f Dockerfile \
    --build-arg ATLANTIS_VERSION=${_ATLANTIS_VERSION} \
    --build-arg DEFAULT_TERRAFORM_VERSION=${_TERRAFORM_VERSION} \
    --platform linux/amd64 -t $(_DOCKER_IMAGE) .

push-base:
    docker push $(_DOCKER_IMAGE)

build-with-docs:
    docker buildx build -f Dockerfile --platform linux/amd64  -t $(_DOCKER_IMAGE) .

push-with-docs:
    docker push $(_DOCKER_IMAGE)
```

This one-time build process ensures every deployed Atlantis Pod has the tool ready to run instantly.

## üõ†Ô∏è Step 2: The Reusable Automation Script

The entire documentation logic is encapsulated in a single, reusable shell script (`terraform-docs-atlantis-workflow.sh`). This keeps our `atlantis.yaml` clean and guarantees a consistent execution environment.

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# This script is used by the atlantis workflow in the atlantis.yaml file

set -e
# Pathing: Finds the absolute repository root path, bypassing the dynamic PR number in the Atlantis workspace path.
# Fixes "No such file or directory" errors.
REPO_ROOT=$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)
cd "$REPO_ROOT"
SEARCH_BASE="terraform/"
    
# --- PHASE 1: Find all directories that contain a variables.tf file under the base path
find "$SEARCH_BASE" -type f -name "variables.tf" ! -path "./.git/*" | \
xargs -n 1 dirname | \
sort -u | \
while read -r module_dir; do
    if [ "$module_dir" != "." ]; then
        echo "Generating docs for: $module_dir"
        (cd "$module_dir" && terraform-docs markdown table . --output-file README.md)
    else
        echo "Skipping root directory."
    fi
done

# --- PHASE 2: COMMIT AND PUSH CHANGES (Requires HTTPS Auth Fix) ---
if git diff --quiet -- "**/README.md"; then
    echo "No documentation changes detected."
else
    # Authentication: Forces Git to use HTTPS and injects the $ATLANTIS_GH_TOKEN directly into the URL.
    git remote set-url origin "[YOUR_GITHUB_REPO_URL]"
    git config --global user.name "[YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME]"
    git config --global user.email "[YOUR_GITHUB_EMAIL]"
      
    git add "**/README.md"
    git commit -m "docs: auto-generate terraform-docs [skip ci]"
      
    echo "Documentation changes committed. Pushing to branch: $HEAD_BRANCH_NAME"
    # Final Action: Pushes the new README.md commit back to the feature branch.
    git push origin $HEAD_BRANCH_NAME
fi
```

## üöÄ Step 3: Integrating into Atlantis Workflow

In our `atlantis.yaml`, we simply execute the script within the `plan` phase of our workflow, right after initialization.

`atlantis.yaml` Workflow Snippet

```yaml
org:
    plan:
      steps:
        # 1. SSH/Initial cleanup (Legacy environment needs this)
        - run: |
            mkdir -p ~/.ssh
            ssh-keyscan -t rsa github.com >> ~/.ssh/known_hosts
            rm -rf .terraform*
            
        # 2. Terraform Init
        - run: terraform init -reconfigure
        
        # 3. Execute the docs generation script
        # NOTE: We use relative pathing to ensure the script is found.
        - run: bash ../../../../scripts/terraform-docs/terraform-docs-atlantis-workflow.sh
        
        # 4. Final Plan Execution
        - run: terraform plan -no-color -input=false -lock=true -compact-warnings
    apply:
      steps:
        - run: terraform apply --auto-approve -no-color -input=false -lock=true -compact-warnings
```

## ‚úÖ Result & Benefits

The automation is now fully integrated and significantly better:

- **Zero Latency:** The tool is already inside the container; no external Cloud Build environment spin-up needed.

- **Simpler Authentication:** We now rely solely on the powerful, secure `ATLANTIS_GH_TOKEN` for all Git read/write operations.

- **Cleaner CI/CD:** Our external Cloud Build files are gone, simplifying the overall platform infrastructure.

This small change has significantly reduced friction, making our module documentation consistently perfect and saving future-us valuable time. üßò
